You have to create a function which receives 3 arguments: 2 numbers, and the result of an unknown operation performed on them (also a number).

Based on those 3 values you have to return a string, that describes which operation was used to get the given result.

The possible return strings are: "addition", "subtraction", "multiplication", "division".

```javascript
function calcType(a, b, res) {
  if( a + b === res){
  return 'addition';
  }
  if( a - b === res){
  return 'subtraction';
  }
  if( a * b === res){
  return 'multiplication';
  }
  if( a / b === res){
  return 'division';
  }
}
```
